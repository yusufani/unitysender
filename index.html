        'I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you as a resident of Unity ' + building + '. I am reaching out to address an issue of increasing concern: the security of our belongings and communal spaces.\n\n' +
        'In recent times, we have observed a troubling uptick in security incidents within the dormitory, including but not limited to the theft of personal items from the garage and communal areas, missing clothes from the laundry, the disappearance of packages left in common spaces, and the accumulation of trash and glass in areas meant to be clean and safe. These incidents have significantly impacted the quality of life and sense of security for all residents.\n\n' +
        'Given the constraints of dormitory living, where students have limited options for securely storing their personal belongings, the need for improved security measures has become ever more pressing. After researching permissible security enhancements on private property, we believe that the installation of security cameras in strategic, communal areas of the dormitory could be a pivotal step towards mitigating these concerns (https://www.reichelt.com/magazin/en/guide/video-surveillance-on-private-property-what-is-allowed/).\n\n' +
        'The proposed security cameras would serve multiple purposes: deterring potential thefts and vandalism, encouraging the maintenance of cleanliness in shared spaces, preventing unauthorized access, and fostering a safer, more secure living environment for everyone.\n\n' +
        'We, the tenants, are eager to work collaboratively with Grammer Management to explore the feasibility, legal compliance, and implementation of this initiative or any logical solution for this issue. Our goal is to enhance the well-being and safety of our community effectively and responsibly. \n\n' +
        'We appreciate your attention to this matter and are hopeful for the opportunity to discuss this proposal further. Your support in making Unity Beta a safer place for all its residents would be invaluable. \n\n' + 
        'Thank you for considering our proposal. We look forward to your positive response and the possibility of working together towards a more secure living environment. \n\n' +
